# Cryptography Toolbox - C# ASP.NET

The Cryptography Toolbox is a comprehensive repository built using C# and ASP.NET, offering a collection of powerful cryptographic algorithms to enhance data security and protection. This repository provides implementations of popular encryption techniques such as Crypto-Encryption, Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and TableSP Cipher, all designed to facilitate secure data transmission and storage.

## Features

1. **Crypto-Encryption**: This module includes robust encryption and decryption functions that utilize advanced cryptographic algorithms, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. It supports various encryption modes like AES, RSA, and symmetric key algorithms, enabling developers to implement secure communication channels and data storage systems.

2. **Caesar Cipher**: The Caesar Cipher implementation in this repository allows for the encryption and decryption of messages using the classical substitution cipher technique. Developers can leverage this functionality to encode and decode text data with a fixed shift value, enhancing basic confidentiality for simple text-based information.

3. **Vigenère Cipher**: The Vigenère Cipher module provides a more sophisticated encryption method based on polyalphabetic substitution. It enables developers to encrypt and decrypt messages using a keyword or passphrase, introducing a higher level of security compared to simpler ciphers like Caesar. This feature is useful for securing sensitive textual information.

4. **TableSP Cipher**: The TableSP Cipher implementation in this repository allows developers to perform encryption and decryption operations using a transposition and substitution-based algorithm. This cipher enhances the security of data by rearranging characters according to a predefined table and applying substitution techniques. It offers an additional layer of protection for various types of data.
